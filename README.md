# Linear Regressor Model

## Overview

This is a manual implementation of the linear regression model, using different solvers. The class is only dependent on numpy, and the entirety of the project has been manually implementing theoretical knowledge of the ``normal equation`` and ``gradient descent``.

## How to Use?

This model could be used by downloading the python file and importing the class through the following code:
`from linear_regressor import LinearRegressor`
Further on, check the class documentation for a detailed description of the class's methods and attributes, in addition to the example notebook in this Github Repository called "Preview.ipynb".

## Credits

This project has been implemented by Abdullah Shwaiky during his internship at Baaz Inc. as a Data Scientist. I would like to thank Mohammad Khaled Danial for his supervision, and the rest of the internship team for being great colleagues during this project.
